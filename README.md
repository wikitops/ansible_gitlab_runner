# Ansible : Playbook Gitlab Runner

The aim of this project is to deploy a simple Gitlab Runner instance on Vagrant.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run this Ansible playbook :

*   [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) must be installed on your computer
*   Update the Vagrant file based on your computer (CPU, memory), if needed
*   You must have download the ubuntu Xenial64 vagrant box :

```bash
$ vagrant box add https://app.vagrantup.com/ubuntu/boxes/xenial64
```
*   If you want to register the Gitlab Runner, you have to get a token from your Gitlab server and configure it in the playbook file

### Usage

A good point with Vagrant is that you can create, update and destroy all architecture easily with some commands.

Be aware that you need to be in the Vagrant directory to be able to run the commands.

#### Build Environment

Vagrant needs to init the project to run and build it :

```bash
$ vagrant up
```

After build, you can check which virtual machine Vagrant has created :

```bash
$ vagrant status
```

If all run like it is expected, you should see something like this :

```bash
$ vagrant status

Current machine states:

runner01               running (virtualbox)
```

#### Deployment

This playbook has some dependencies to other roles that must be downloaded before executing the playbook :

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

This command should download the Docker role from Ansible Galaxy to the local role path.

To deploy the Gitlab Runner instance, you just have to run the Ansible playbook gitlab-runner.yml with this command :

```bash
$ ansible-playbook gitlab-runner.yml
```

If everything run as expected, the runner should be register on your Gitlab server.

#### Destroy

To destroy on what Vagrant has created, just run this command :

```bash
$ vagrant destroy
```
